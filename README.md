# QR-Code-Generator
A QR Code Generator in Python creates QR codes from user-provided text or URLs. It typically uses the qrcode library to generate QR codes and Pillow to handle image processing. The script initializes a QR code object, adds data, customizes size and color, and then generates and saves the QR code as an image.
